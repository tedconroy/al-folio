I grew up in Half Moon Bay, California, and then went to the University of Hawaii at Manoa for an undergraduate degree and the University of Oregon for a Masters degree.

In my free time I enjoy surfing, being in the mountains, and climbing rocks. My latest hobby has been searching for rocks that haven't been climbed yet.
