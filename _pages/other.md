In my free time I enjoy surfing, being in the mountains, and climbing rocks. My latest hobby has been searching for rocks that haven't been climbed yet, which entails spending time on the internet (mainly google earth and topographic data) and lots of hiking. To check out some of the climbing areas my friends and I have found, you can check out my mountain project page.
