I grew up in Half Moon Bay, California. I then went to the University of Hawaii at Manoa for an undergraduate degree (thesis with Brian Powell), and to the University of Oregon for a Masters degree (thesis with David Sutherland). I am currently a PhD student at the University of Waikato in Aotearoa New Zealand, working with Karin Bryan.

I am mostly interested in physical oceanography in coastal areas. These are areas that we can readily visit, observe, and have a significant impact on many peoples lives around the world. 

In my free time I enjoy surfing, being in the mountains, and climbing rocks.
