I grew up in Half Moon Bay, California, and then went to the University of Hawaii at Manoa for an undergraduate degree and the University of Oregon for a Masters degree. I am currently a PhD student at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, working with Karin Bryan.

In my free time I enjoy surfing, being in the mountains, and climbing rocks.
