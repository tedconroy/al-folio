I am researching the water and suspended sediment movement in Hawke Bay, NZ. There are a range of scales involved from the nearshore to individual river plumes to inner shelf dynamics. I'm using a combination of remote sensing, observational data and numerical ocean modeling (with COAWST) to study these.
