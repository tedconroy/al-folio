Like many estuaries, the Coos Estuary in Oregon has undergone significant development and modification in the last 150 years. The goal of this work was to understand how the physical modification of the estuary, including shoreline and bathymetry change, has altered the tidal propagation and fluxes of salt throughout the estuary, which are key to understanding the transport and salinity distribution in the estuary.

Using historic navigation charts, shoreline position and a bathymetry data were extracted to create a time series of change until the present. The estuarine area has decreased, yet the volume of the estuary has increased due to dredging.

A numerical ocean model of the estuary was used with three configurations: **1)** pre-dredging state, **2)** current state, and **3)** proposed state with a deeper navigation channel. It was found that the deepening has altered the tidal dynamics and increased the salinity intrusion into the estuary. Although the tidal salt flux is the dominant landward salt flux component (Conroy et. al 2020), the increase in depth has increased the subtidal salt flux component, decreased the tidal salt flux component, and the total landward salt flux has increased, increasing the salinity intrusion. 

The reduction in tidal salt flux is consistent with being proportional to the along channel velocity magnitude, which decreased corresponding with a deeper channel. This work highlights that altering an estuary's geometry can influence salt flux mechanisms and ultimately alter the salinity distribution in an estuary.
